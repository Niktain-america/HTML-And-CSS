The HTML specifications require that you provide alternative text to describe each image on a web page. Use the alt attribute with IMG element to add this information to your markup. When browsers don't display an image, they display alternative text instead.
When browsers show an image, they show title text as pop-up tips when you hover your mouse pointer over an image for a few seconds. This means you can use alternative text to describe the image to those who can't see it and /or title text to provide useful information about the same image.
